# Assignment: Data Science Scenarios

In this first assignment, we ask you to think about some real-life process or problem in different problem domains, and how you can improve it using the Data Science process. Think about the following:

1. Which data can you collect?
1. How would you collect it?
1. How would you store the data? How large the data is likely to be?
1. Which insights you might be able to get from this data? Which decisions we would be able to take based on the data?

Try to think about 3 different problems/processes and describe each of the points above for each problem domain.

Here are some of the problem domains and problems that can get you started thinking:

1. How can you use data to improve education process for children in schools?
1. How can you use data to control vaccination during the pandemic?
1. How can you use data to make sure you are being productive at work?
## Instructions

Fill in the following table (substitute suggested problem domains for your own ones if needed):

| Problem Domain | Problem | Which data to collect | How to store the data | Which insights/decisions we can make | 
|----------------|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Partizipation | Monitoring and analysing addendance at city and local councils meeting | Addendance lists of city and local council meetings | Excel | Gaining insights into partizipation into local politics. Questioning if the meetings times, format (in-person /hybrid) and locations should be changed |
| Bike traffic |Roads bicyclists are taking. To make bike rides more save. |Traffic data via cameras on roads. Survey. |csv files | Which ways are used by cyclists. |
| Local Budgeting |What projects and areas are profiting from local budgeting|Analysis on approved local Budgeting applications |xlsx file |Is it a good mix on approved projects? Are there areas that not get funding? |
